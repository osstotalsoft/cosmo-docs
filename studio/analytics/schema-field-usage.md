This usage tracking is accessible from the schema explorer and the schema check page. It is available for all GraphQL types. You get a breakdown of every client that uses it and which operations in each one of those clients as well along with the number of requests made by them.

You also get a list of subgraphs that requested that field. You can select date and time filters and check when was the first and last seen for that particular field.
