# Overrides

## Configuring overrides

Whenever you run a check against a subgraph we detect breaking changes that affect various operations. On the check page, for each operation you can configure overrides whether they are safe or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
Applying overrides will not change the outcome of the check run. Only future checks will take them into account.
{% endhint %}

You can also toggle overrides for all changes in the click of a button. Setting `Ignore All` will consider all current and new breaking changes as safe for the operation.

## Viewing all overrides

You can view all overrides in a single place. From here you can open the configuration to fine tune existing overrides or go to metrics/traces to check current usage.
