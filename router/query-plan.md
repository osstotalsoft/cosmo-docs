# Query Plan

Include the header `X-WG-Include-Query-Plan` to receive the query plan in the extensions field. The below headers are also useful

`X-WG-Skip-Loader` : Skip requests to subgraph, this will return data as null

`X-WG-Disable-Tracing` : This will ensure that requests for query plan are not traced in the router
